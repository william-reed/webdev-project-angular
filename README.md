# SMS Reminder
This project allows users to schedule future text messages to be sent to themselves. They can also subscribe to regularly occuring notifications (utilizing various API's) in anything from jokes, quotes, and trivia.

This is the angular front end portion of the site. Run the site using `ng serve`. If running locally you will need to change the cors settings on the node server (in `server.js`) to allow for connections from localhost.

The actual SMS sending service is not currently running but feel free to check out the site here:
